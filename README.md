# Overview

This program is designed to be a simple tool used by students to calculate their Grade Point Average (GPA) or their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). I am currently a full time student and just a few weeks ago I was trying to calcualte my GPA for all of my major-specific courses (I am currently studying to get a degree in Computer Science). Its fairly straightforward to calculate, but I wanted to build a simple tool to accomplish this. I also have been wanting to learn the basics of the C++ programming language, and hadnt had any hands on experience with it before this. So, I decided to put these two things together and use building this as an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of C++ by creating this program.

# Development Environment

I used VScode to write this code in the C++ programming language. I had to install C++ compiler as well as the C++ extension in vscode in order to be able to build and run the program(s) I created in this project. Learning more about the compiler was a really interesting part of this project, and frankly I spent almost as much time learning about and setting that up as I did writing the program.

# Future Work-Things to improve or add in the future

- Enhanced user interface, smoothness of functionality. Making sure you can seamlessly toggle between each option within the program and the main menu.
- Database connection for the user to store and keep track of their information, so they can track their progress over time.
- Error handling and input validation
